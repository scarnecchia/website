##Drone Photogrammetry Calculator
This is a small suite of tools for calculating values necessary for photogrammetry. The target audience is people using small drones for mapping and 3d modeling.

###Pixel Size Calculator
Calculate the size (pitch) of a pixel given the dimensions of your image sensor and the number of pixels in an image it creates. This assumes square pixels.

###Ground Sample Distance Calculator
Calculates the Ground Sample Distance (GSD), which is the distance covered by one pixel as it is measured on the ground for a given pixel size, focal length, and altitude (AGL.)

###Altitude
Calculates the altitute (AGL) necessary to acheive a specific ground sample distance for a given pixel size and focal length. N.B. Altitude is defined as Above Ground Level (AGL).
